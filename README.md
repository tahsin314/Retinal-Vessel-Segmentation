# Retinal Vessel Segmentation
This repository contains codes for the *autoencoder* described in the paper [Retinal Vein detection using Residual Block Incorporated U-Net Architecture and Fuzzy Inference System
](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/329164442_Retinal_Vein_detection_using_Residual_Block_Incorporated_U-Net_Architecture_and_Fuzzy_Inference_System). I used the train set of [*DRIVE*](https://www.isi.uu.nl/Research/Databases/DRIVE/) dataset for training and
it's test dataset along with data from [*STARE*](http://cecas.clemson.edu/~ahoover/stare/) for testing.

Here are the performance metrics measured on both datasets using my model.

### Requirements
* Numpy
* OpenCV
* Keras
* Tensorflow
* Scikit-learn

### Dataset Preprocessing
All images were manually converted to **.tiff* since *OpenCV* can not read images from *DRIVE* and *STARE* with other formats.
The images were extracted and kept under the directory `./data/`. 

### Training
Run `train.py`. Change label name with your labels in line `28` and `42`

### Evaluation
Run `eval.py`. Change label name with your lables in line `21`
